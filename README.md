# Location Information Repository

The source of country, city, and district information in this repository is:  
[https://github.com/halisogluiskender/](https://github.com/halisogluiskender/) (🙏)

This simple repository attempts to find desired coordinates through URL requests on OpenStreetMap with some search optimizations. It's not perfect,, but it gets the job done for the most part.

That's all from me for now. Feel free to contribute or use it as needed!
